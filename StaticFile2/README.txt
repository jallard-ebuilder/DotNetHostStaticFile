A simple demo of how to host a static file using dotnet.

This started as a WebAPI project, then reduced. The startup file and nuget packages have been reduced to bare bones.

Demo:

/test.js - static file - in the real world, this will be a js file containing one or more web components.
/health - health endpoint
